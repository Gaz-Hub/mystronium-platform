# ðŸš€ MYSTRONIUM PLATFORM - DEPLOYMENT READY

## âœ… Firebase Environment Variables Fixed

### What was resolved:
- Removed placeholder values from `netlify.toml` that were overriding dashboard environment variables
- All required Firebase environment variables are now properly set in Netlify dashboard:
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` âœ…
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` âœ…
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` âœ…
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` âœ…
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` âœ…
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` âœ…
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` âœ…
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` âœ…
  - `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` âœ…

### Next Steps:
1. Netlify will automatically deploy these changes
2. Clear cache and redeploy: Deploys â†’ Trigger deploy â†’ Clear cache and deploy site
3. Test Firebase functionality on live site
4. Check browser console for Firebase initialization messages

### Expected Result:
- No more "Missing required Firebase environment variables" errors
- Firebase authentication, database, and storage should work properly
- App Check with reCAPTCHA should initialize successfully
